A Power BI dashboard analyzing ad metrics like ROAS and CTR.
# 📈 Meta (Facebook) Ad Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Meta (Facebook & Instagram) advertising campaigns. The dashboard tracks performance, identifies high-value demographics, and optimizes ad spend for maximum Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Evaluate Campaign Efficiency:** Analyze cost per result (CPR) and click-through rates (CTR) across different campaigns.
* **Optimize Budget Allocation:** Identify underperforming ad sets to reduce wasted spend.
* **Demographic Targeting:** Determine which Age Groups, Genders, and Locations yield the highest conversion rates.
* **Trend Analysis:** Monitor daily/weekly performance changes to detect ad fatigue.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
* **Top Performing Demographics:** The **20-30** age group (especially early 20s) showed the highest engagement[cite: 36]. Females accounted for **43%** of engagement, outperforming males (22%).
* **Ad Format Efficiency:** **Video ads** delivered the highest performance across CTR (11.9%), Conversion Rate (5.2%), and Engagement Rate (13.7%.
* **Funnel Analysis:** While awareness is strong with a high **CTR of 11.76%** and **Engagement Rate of 13.56%** , the purchase rate is **0.61%**, indicating a need for landing page optimization.
* **Geographic Trends:** High engagement volume was observed in **India, US, and Brazil**, with recommendations to focus premium campaigns in the UK/Germany for better conversion potential.
* **Peak Time:** The highest engagement rates occurred in the **late afternoon & evening (~3 PM - 8 PM)**, suggesting optimal times for scheduling ads.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data visualization and interactive dashboarding.
* **Power Query:** For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data cleaning, and standardization.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating complex measures such as:
    * `ROAS = [Total Revenue] / [Total Ad Spend]`
    * `CTR = [Total Clicks] / [Total Impressions]`
    * `Conversion Rate = [Total Conversions] / [Total Clicks]`

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The analysis is based on standard Meta Ads data containing the following key dimensions and metrics:
* **Dimensions:** Campaign Name, Ad Set Name, Date, Age, Gender, Platform (FB/IG), Placement.
* **Metrics:** Amount Spent (Total: 2.5M), Impressions (216K), Clicks (25.4K), Purchases (1.3K).
